This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, implemented in TypeScript.

## Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels. This project aims to provide solutions for these puzzles using TypeScript, showcasing problem-solving skills and TypeScript coding practices.
